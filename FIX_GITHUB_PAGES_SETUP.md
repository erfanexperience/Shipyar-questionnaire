# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Configuration

## ⚠️ Current Issues:

1. **Folder is set to root** (`/ (root)`) instead of `/early`
2. **DNS still not configured correctly** - A records missing

---

## 🎯 Option 1: Access at `shippyar.com/early` (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create `/early` Folder Structure

Run the setup script:
```bash
setup-github-pages.bat
```

Or manually:
1. Create `early` folder in repository root
2. Copy these files to `early/`:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `Logo-v2.png`
   - `wall.png`

### Step 2: Update GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to: `https://github.com/erfanexperience/Shipyar-questionnaire/settings/pages`
2. Under **Source** → **Branch**:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/early` ← **Change this from `/ (root)` to `/early`**
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Fix DNS (Still Required!)

You still need to:
- ✅ Add A record: `185.199.109.153`
- ❌ Delete A record: "WebsiteBuilder Site"

Then wait 1-4 hours for DNS propagation.

## 🎯 Option 2: Access at `shippyar.com` (Root Domain)

If you want the site at the root domain instead of `/early`:

### Step 1: Keep Current Settings
- Folder: `/ (root)` ← Keep as is
- Files stay in repository root

### Step 2: Update Paths (If Needed)
- No changes needed if files are already in root

### Step 3: Still Fix DNS
- Same DNS fixes required

## 📋 Recommendation

**I recommend Option 1** (`shippyar.com/early`) because:
- Keeps the backend files separate
- Cleaner URL structure
- Easier to manage

---

## ✅ After Making Changes:

1. **Commit and push** if you created `/early` folder:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Move files to early folder"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for GitHub Pages to rebuild** (1-2 minutes)

3. **Fix DNS records in GoDaddy** (still required!)

4. **Wait for DNS propagation** (1-4 hours)

5. **Click "Check again"** in GitHub Pages settings

6. **Once DNS passes**: HTTPS will automatically be enabled within 24 hours
